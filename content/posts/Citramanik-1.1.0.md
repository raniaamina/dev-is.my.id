Citramanik is a powerful tool to help your productivity with Inkscape. This tool will reads ID patterns (i.e icon-small, page-medium, page-big, etc) that you've set and then exports them to the file format that you need. Citramanik allows you to feel like you are working with artboards or multiple pages in Inkscape.

Today, we officially announce that Citramanik will begin to be publicly released! Several months ago, Devlovers ID opened a donation for a special donor launch, and as required the minimum donation amount for a public release has been reached.
